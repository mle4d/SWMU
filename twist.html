      At Saleswhale, we believe that the future of work is Collaborative Intelligence
       - where machines and AI help humans fulfil their highest potential by automating
        drudgery and producing for more effective results.<br><br>AI assistants help to automate
         repetitive and mundane tasks so that us humans focus on creative, high-impact work
          that creates value and inspires. The result? Happier and more productive teams doing
           meaningful work.<br><br>Our mission is to put an AI assistant in every company that could
            greatly benefit from it, and we're starting off strong addressing this need in
             marketing and sales teams all across the world.<br><br>The future is where AI and humans
              work hand in hand, and weâ€™re here to help businesses benefit from that.
